Sure, Felipe — Sheldon here — I'm going to create a **minimalist, modern, and elegant visual identity**, specifically designed for a **desktop reading app**, focusing on:

* organization
* visual comfort
* productivity
* low distraction

And nothing complicated — just clear guidelines that give the app personality.

---

# 🎨 **Minimalist Visual Identity — Desktop Reading**

The proposal here is a **calm, clean, silent, and elegant** style that gives a sense of focus and depth — inspired by:

* **Notion**
* **Obsidian without plugins**
* **Apple Books**
* **Bear App**
* **Raindrop.io**
* **Minimal Pocket**

Everything with **minimal ornamentation**, based on strong typography, ample space, and soft colors.

---

# 🎨 1. **Color Palette**

The palette is designed to have **two versions**: light and dark.
We'll keep everything **monochromatic with two highlights** to avoid overwhelming.

---

## 🌞 **Light Theme – "Library White"**

# 🖋️ 2. **Typography**

The app should convey **quietude and comfortable reading** — so no fancy fonts.

### 📌 Recommended options:

* **Inter** (main) — Modern, readable, synthetic
* **Source Serif Pro** (for notes and long passages) — literary vibe
* **SF Pro** (if the app is Mac-focused) — native, very clean
* **Roboto Serif** — elegant alternative

### Convention:

* Titles → weight **600–700**
* Subtitles → weight **500**
* Body text → weight **400**
* Captions and metadata → weight **300**

### Spacing:

* Generous line height: **1.6 to 1.75**
* Letters with light tracking in titles (+1 to +4)

---

# 🧱 3. **Grid and Layout**

### 🧭 General aesthetic line:

**Visual breathing** + **thin cards** + **focus on content**.

### Rules:

* Large padding: **24–32px**
* Card corners: **8px** (minimalist square)
* Vertical distance between sections: **24px**
* Fixed sidebar with 64–72px width
* Content always aligned in invisible columns (12-col grid)

---

# 📐 4. **Minimalist Style Components**

### 📚 **Book cards**

* White background (or dark gray in dark mode).
* Soft shadow (only on hover).
* Book cover in 3:2 ratio.
* Title and author below, without borders or extra boxes.
* Progress indicator as a **thin 2–3px line**.

### 🔍 **Search field**

* Thin bar, no border.
* Light gray background (#F3F4F6).
* Small icon on the left.
* 6px rounded corners.
* Placeholder with reduced opacity.

### 🧭 **Sidebar**

* Minimalist, no borders.
* Monochromatic icons (outline, HeroIcons style).
* Text with secondary gray.
* The active item receives:

  * slightly blue background (`#E0F2FE` in light, `#1E3A8A22` in dark)
  * left border of 2–3px blue.

### ⏱️ **Timer**

* "Concentrated" style: simple circles, no ornaments.
* Large, spacious buttons.
* Central text with large monospaced font (e.g., optional JetBrains Mono).

### 📊 **Charts**

* Minimalist, without heavy axes.
* Thin lines.
* Few labels.
* Colors restricted to blue + green palette.

---

# ✨ 5. **Iconography**

Use **outline** style, thin, consistent.

Suggestion:
**HeroIcons Outline** (open source, clean, modern).

Examples:

* Book: `book-open`
* Sessions: `clock`
* Goals: `flag`
* Statistics: `chart-bar`
* Notes: `document-text`
* Calendar: `calendar`
* Settings: `cog`

All with stroke 1.5–1.75px.

---

# 🌈 6. **Minimalist Microinteractions**

This is where the app gains personality without clutter.

* Smooth hover with **0.15s**.
* Fade and slide animations **with smooth easing** (`cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)`).
* Animated reading progress with light bar "fill".
* Achievements appear with microanimation:

  * fade-in + scale from 0.95 → 1.0 over 180ms.
* Timer gives a light pulse every minute (subtle!).

Nothing flashy — just a touch of life.

---

# 🎭 7. **Emotional Identity**

### Desired feeling:

* **Calm**
* **Depth**
* **Organization**
* **Lightness**
* **Total focus on content**

### Style keywords:

* Paper-like
* Mindful

---

# 🧬 8. **Minimalist Branding**

## 🪶 App name (minimalist suggestions):

* **Marcapágina**
* **Scripta**
* **Leitura+**

## ✏️ Logo (style description)

* Simple shapes (circle + page marker).

* Can be just two lines forming a stylized open book.
* Another idea: a rectangle with a marker on top (like a post-it).

Nothing with strong gradients or heavy shadows.

---

# 🧵 9. **Tone and Interface Style Guide**

### 🔹 Writing (microtexts and UX writing):

* Short
* Calm
* Not childish
* Not technical
* Tones like:

  * "Continue reading"
  * "Record session"
  * "Add book"
  * "Goal completed!"
  * "Pages read today"

### 🔹 General tone:

* Friendly, but not overly gamified.
* Serious enough for academics.
* Light enough for casual readers.

---

# 🎨 10. **Accessibility & Visual Comfort**

Since this is an app for **reading about reading** and used daily, accessibility and visual comfort are formalized as requirements.

### 🔤 **Global Font Size Adjustment:**

* Three sizes available: **Small**, **Standard**, **Large**
* Applies globally to all text elements
* Adjustable independently for:
  * Titles
  * Body text
  * UI elements (buttons, labels)
* Persists across sessions

### 🎨 **Theme & Contrast:**

* Light/dark theme (already in visual identity, formalized as requirement)
* Adequate contrast ratios for readability (WCAG AA compliance)
* Optional high contrast mode for accessibility needs
* Smooth theme transitions without jarring changes

### 🔍 **High Focus Mode:**

* Reduces decorative elements
* Hides secondary graphs and cards
* Focuses on essential elements:
  * Current book
  * Progress indicator
  * "Start session" button
* Minimalist interface for distraction-free reading sessions
* Complements Immersive Mode but is formalized as an accessibility requirement

### 💡 **Visual Comfort Requirements:**

* Comfortable reading environment for extended use
* Reduced eye strain through proper spacing and contrast
* Clear visual hierarchy without overwhelming elements

---

# 📦 11. **Visual Summary (in a few words)**

**Minimalist + Monochromatic + Blue/Green as highlights + Elegant Typography + Ample Spacing + Clean Cards + Smooth Microanimations + Accessible + Comfortable for Extended Use.**

This style works perfectly for a reading app because it conveys:

* depth
* focus
* organization
* visual quietude
* accessibility
* long-term comfort

Perfect for recording readings without distraction.
