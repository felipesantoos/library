Nice question, because this is exactly the kind of thing that creeps in “by accident” if you don’t decide it upfront. 😄

Short answer:
**With what we have now, the app is *not* strongly thematic.**
It’s **content-first, minimalist productivity**, with *subtle* book/library references.

Let me break that down.

## What the current spec implies

From the visual identity you pasted, the current direction is:

* Inspired by **Notion / Obsidian / Apple Books UI** → clean, neutral, productive
* Palette is **cool gray + blue/green accents** → modern productivity, not cozy library
* Components are generic: cards, lists, sidebar, charts, search → nothing “wood + bookshelves”
* Copy/UX writing is neutral: “Continue reading”, “Record session”, “Add book” → slightly reading-themed, but still generic

So right now the “theme” is basically:

> **“Quiet, minimalist productivity app that *happens* to be about reading.”**

The *reading theme* comes mostly from **the data itself**:

* book covers
* titles, authors
* pages, notes, sessions
* charts about reading

…and from a few UI metaphors like:

* book icon in the sidebar
* “Book of the week”
* “Pages read today”

But you’re **not** doing a “storybook app” with:

* wood textures
* bookshelf UI
* page-flip animations
* super literal metaphors (“your sessions are little books”, etc.)

---

## Options: how thematic do you want to be?

You basically have 3 possible lanes:

### 1️⃣ Neutral productivity (where you are now)

* Theme = **“calm workspace”**
* Reading shows up only in:

  * data (books, notes, stats)
  * a few icons/labels
* Pros:

  * Feels professional (good for academics, researchers).
  * Ages bem, não fica “infantil”.
  * Easy to extend para outros tipos de conteúdo no futuro (papers, notes, etc.).
* Cons:

  * Less “cute” or “cozy”.
  * Less instant personality.

This is **what we have now**.

### 2️⃣ Light “reading/library” theme (my recommendation for you)

Same minimalist base, but with **strategic book/paper metaphors** in a few places:

* Logo looks like a subtle **book/page/bookmark**.
* Empty states with small illustrations:

  * “Your shelf is empty”
  * “No sessions this week yet — time to open a chapter?”
* Wording:

  * “Shelf” or “Library” instead of “Collection”
  * “Stack” for groups of books
  * “Chapter of your year” in the annual report copy
* Icons:

  * book-open, bookmark, document-text, etc. (already in the visual spec)

So visually it stays **Notion-like**, but semantically it clearly belongs to the world of **books / pages / reading**.

> This keeps the app serious, but gives it identity.

---

### 3️⃣ Full themed “library app”

You could go hard on theme:

* Shelves as visual metaphor
* Book stacks for collections
* Wooden tones, paper background texture
* Achievements with names tipo “Golden Bookmark”, “Full Bookshelf Month” etc.

Personally, isso foge um pouco da vibe que você já definiu:

* Você quer algo que sirva tanto pra **ficção casual** quanto pra **mestranda da Carolina** e pro **engenheiro do Ricardo**.
* Um tema muito lúdico atrapalha especialmente o público mais acadêmico/produtivo.

## So… what are we making?

Given everything you definiu até agora, eu descreveria o app assim:

> **“A minimalist, calm reading workspace with subtle book/library touches, but not a gimmicky ‘themed app’.”**

Or in practice:

* **Base visual:** productivity tool (Notion/Obsidian vibe)
* **Theme layer:**

  * icons (books, bookmarks, documents)
  * copy (“shelf”, “library”, “chapter”)
  * logo + empty states with bookish metaphors
  * achievements and reports with reading-related naming

You’re not making a “toy library” UI.
You’re making a **serious, quiet reading cockpit** that just happens to love books. 📚

---

If you want, I can:

* Propose **concrete “thematic touches”** (phrases, empty states, achievement names, icon choices) that keep it subtle, or
* Write a tiny **“Design Principles” section** like:
  *“Content-first, reading-themed but not skeuomorphic, minimalist, calm, professional.”*
