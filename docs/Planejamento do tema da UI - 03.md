# 🖋️ 2. **Typography — “Printed Manuscript”**

You want the UI to feel like walking into an old rare-book room.

## Primary Typeface — Serif (Classical Typesetting)

**Cormorant Garamond**
or
**Crimson Text**

These fonts bring:

* elegance
* academia
* old-world confidence

## Secondary Typeface — Body Text (Readable Antique)

**Literata**
or
**Merriweather**

## Metadata Font — Monospace Calligraphy Inspiration

**iA Writer Mono**
or
**JetBrains Mono** (slight modernity)

## Rules

* Titles: serif, weight 600–700
* Subtitles: serif, italic optional
* Body: serif, weight 400
* Notes & logs: light serif or env. mono
* Letterspacing: slight negative (-1 to -2) for titles
* Line height: **1.75** (book-like)

---

# 🧱 3. **UI Components — Fully Antique**

Everything is now themed around:

* parchment
* paper fibers
* brass bookmarks
* leather edges
* manuscript layouts

Let’s define every major component.

---

## 📚 **Bookshelf (Library Page) — “Antique Oak Shelf”**

UI metaphor:
Your library is a **refined wooden shelf**.

### Visual:

* Subtle oak texture (VERY subtle, not kitschy)
* Book covers aligned like a real shelf
* Optional **spine-only view** (vertical narrow cards)
* Brass labels for categories (e.g., “In Progress”, “Completed”)

### Microinteractions:

* Hover = book gently pulls outward
* Select = gold-foil border appears around the card
* Drag = looks like sliding a book across a shelf

---

## 📘 **Book Card — “Mini Leather Tome”**

Elements:

* Slight embossing around edges
* Gold or brass foil title highlight
* Tiny cloth bookmark indicator for "reading"
* Pages represented with subtle side texture

States:

* Currently reading → **Burgundy ribbon**
* Completed → **Gold-edged pages**
* Abandoned → **Dusty fade overlay**

---

## 📄 **Notes — “Marginalia & Manuscript Pages”**

Remember: you want this to look like a scholar’s study desk.

### Style:

* Slight parchment texture background
* Faint ruling lines (light brown)
* Page number displayed in ornate serif
* Optional **ink blot** decoration for realism (very subtle)
* Notes pinned with:

  * brass pins
  * wax seals (optional)
  * paperclip drawn in thin ink

### Feeling:

**You’re annotating manuscripts.**

---

## 📜 **Sessions — “Reading Logbook”**

Sessions page resembles an **antique logbook**:

* “Date” written in an elegant serif with a decorative underline
* Divider lines like journal rulings
* Timer displayed in “old pocket watch” style (but minimalist)

Highlight when a session starts:

* glowing “candle flicker” micro animation
* timer pulses softly like a heartbeat

---

## 🧮 **Statistics — “Scholar’s Observatory”**

Charts are not neon modern, but:

* Brass-gold lines
* Thin ink-line charts
* Aging effect on axes
* Bars resemble books spines
* Heatmap looks like an **ancient calendar with stamped marks**

---

## 🧭 **Sidebar — “Library Catalog Tabs”**

Sidebar items mimic **catalog cards** or **brass-labeled drawers**.

### Appearance:

* Background: aged parchment
* Icons: engraved serif icons
* Active item:

  * gold underline
  * small bookmark indicator icon

---

# ✨ 4. **Microinteractions — Antique Edition**

These are crucial for immersion.

### Page flip animation (when opening a book)

Tiny, elegant 120ms animation.

### Bookmark drop

When completing a book:

* a **gold bookmark ribbon** gently falls and attaches to the book card.

### Candle flicker pulse

Timer pulses very slightly every minute.

### Ink fill progress bar

Progress bars fill like **ink spreading on paper fibres**.

### Wax seal pop

When completing goals:

* A **wax seal stamp** animation appears, shrinks slightly, then settles.

---

# 🔖 5. **Copywriting — Full Antique Tone**

Replace every neutral text with **scholarly, literary, or archival wording**.

### Examples:

| Neutral          | Antique                 |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| Library          | The Bookshelf           |
| Notes            | Marginalia              |
| Sessions         | Reading Log             |
| Statistics       | Scholar's Metrics       |
| Goals            | Reading Quests          |
| Continue Reading | Resume the Chapter      |
| Add Book         | Add a Tome to the Shelf |
| Start Session    | Begin a Reading Ritual  |
| Today’s Progress | Pages of the Day        |
| Completed        | Fully Read              |
| Abandoned        | Left Unfinished         |
| Current Book     | Your Active Volume      |

Even buttons become thematic:

* **“Record Session” → “Inscribe Entry”**
* **“Edit Book” → “Revise Manuscript”**
* **“Save” → “Commit to the Ledger”**
* **“Delete” → “Remove from Archives”**
